### Write a Python script that creates and manages Azure Virtual Machines


The goal of this challenge is to create a Python script that can interact with the Azure Virtual Machines 
service to create and manage virtual machines. The script should be able to create new virtual machines, 
start and stop existing virtual machines, and delete virtual machines.


Here are some specific requirements for the script:


- 1. Authentication: The script should use Azure Active Directory authentication to access the Azure 
Virtual Machines service. You will need to create an Azure Active Directory application and grant 
it the necessary permissions to access the Virtual Machines service.
- 2. Virtual machine creation: The script should be able to create new virtual machines in Azure. You 
will need to specify the virtual machine size, operating system, and storage account.
- 3. Virtual machine management: The script should be able to start and stop existing virtual 
machines in Azure. You will need to provide the virtual machine name and resource group.
- 4. Virtual machine deletion: The script should be able to delete virtual machines in Azure. You will 
need to provide the virtual machine name and resource group.
- 5. Error handling: The script should include appropriate error handling to handle cases where 
virtual machines cannot be created, started, stopped, or deleted.
- 6. Feedback: The script should provide feedback to the user on the success or failure of the virtual 
machine operations.


To complete this challenge, you will need to have a basic understanding of Azure Virtual Machines and 
how to interact with the Azure API using Python. You can find more information on the Azure Virtual 
Machines service and the Azure Python SDK in the Azure documentation. Good luck!
